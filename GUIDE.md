# guide
okay lets begin. i'm actually pretty lazy so instead of newlines which would mess up a lot of stuff while writing the interpreter i used `^` as line breaks. SO SHOULD YOU. or your program won't run. BITCH.

# basic commands
 - `log hi` be loggin
 - `clear` be clearin
 - `dev` be functionin
# tf is dev :|
```l
dev test
    log hi @
    log hello @
    log this is function :trol:
    ^
```
